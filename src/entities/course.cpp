	/* What's going on here? ... Let me explain :)
	 * A course manages a list of lessons. Both classes inherit from Resource.
	 * To be able to later ask any Lesson for the Course it corresponds to,
	 * the Lesson must hold a reference back to its Course.
	 * Managing this is a bit tricky because we must ensure two things.
	 * 1. When the course is deleted it is not allowed to delete a Lesson that
	 * was passed out to a client. Here the solution is quite simple:
	 * Use smart pointers to store the Lessons. The Lesson is then deleted but
	 * the Lesson passed out stays valid, as long as the client holds a reference
	 * to it.
	 * 2. After the Course is deleted, the Lesson must not return the reference
	 * to the Course it belonged to, because the memory is already freed.
	 * Here we can use a weak pointer (here called "mCourse").
	 * BUT: The parent pointers stored inside the Lessons must be initialized
	 * by the same shared pointer to the Course, because they must share the same
	 * reference counter.
	 * (Rule: Never store the same address in multiple smart pointers!)
	 * So there must be a single smart pointer to the Course that can be used to
	 * initialize the parent pointers.
	 * (Note: In this case, it would be possible to use the same variable for
	 * both, weak this and weak parent pointer, because only one of them is
	 * used at the same time. But then we would use one variable for two
	 * different purposes.)
	 * This factory method ensures that there is always a shared pointer (and
	 * with a reference count of min. 1) that lives as long as the Course lives.
	 * This pointer is used to initialize the weak pointer in the base class.
	 * And that weak pointer is then used to initialize the parent pointers of
	 * the Lessons.
	 * How tricky ...
